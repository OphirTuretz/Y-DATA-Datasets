# Ziprecruiter Data Science Exercise
You are given a file containing a set of jobs with their categories (numerical)

You need to build a classifier for these classes


## Desired output:
* Any intermediate insights, reports, analysis, data quality issues you think it may be interesting (with the code \ logic used to create them)
* Any assumptions you made during the exercise (feel free to make assumptions you believe are reasonable)
* How would you evaluate the quality of the model?
* How does the model perform? what would you improve? did you have specific reasons for choosing this solution?
* The code used to train the model
* The code to classify new jobs (assume same input format)

## Notes:
* You may use any relevant 3rd party library or framework
* All code should be runnable (please supply needed scripts \ instructions needed to reproduce the outputs)
* No need to invest in automatic model \ hyperparemeter optimization - but if initial results suggest a specific change in the model will help, it would be good to test this assumption
* if you don't have experience working with text data in ML, this is a good starting point: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/text_analytics/working_with_text_data.html
